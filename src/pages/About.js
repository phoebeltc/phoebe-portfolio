            <h3>HEY! I â€˜m Phoebe.</h3>
            <h4>After working 2 years as a web designer in Hong Kong, I now decided to be a front-end developer in London on exciting ideas and codes.  
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I enjoy creating beautiful, accessible and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, SASS, SCSS and React. I am currently learning Typescript as well. I combined my web design expertise with front-end development which help to build the website looking close to the design.</h4>
